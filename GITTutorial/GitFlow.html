            <p>A GIT Workflow dictates what kind of branches to set up and how to merge them together. One of the most popular branching and merging workflow models is <a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/" target="_blank">GitFlow</a>. At a glance, this is the <a href="reference/GitFlow-branching-model.pdf" target="_blank">GitFlow Workflow</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: There are two main branches with an infinite lifetime:</p>
            <ul>
                <li style ="color: black;">master</li>
                <li style ="color: black;">develop</li>
            </ul>

                    <li>A <strong>develop</strong> branch is created from <strong>master</strong></li>
                    <li>A <strong>release</strong> branch is created from <strong>develop</strong></li>

                    <li>When the <strong>release</strong> branch is done it is merged into <strong>develop</strong> and <strong>master</strong></li>
                    <li>If an issue in <strong>master</strong> is detected a <strong>hotfix</strong> branch is created from <strong>master</strong></li>
                    <li>Once the <strong>hotfix</strong> is complete it is merged to both <strong>develop</strong> and <strong>master</strong></li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div class="accordion-toggle">

                <p>
                    A <strong>master branch</strong> is created
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <strong>develop branch</strong> is created from <strong>master</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    New development (new features, non-emergency bug fixes) are built in <strong>feature branches</strong>:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="reference/gitflow/GitFlowFeatureBranches.png" alt="GitFlow feature branches" />
                </p>
                <p>
                    Feature branches are branched off of the <strong>develop branch</strong>, and finished features and fixes are merged back into the <strong>develop branch</strong> when they’re ready for release:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="reference/gitflow/GitFlowDevelopBranch.png" alt="GitFlow develop branch" />
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it is time to make a release, a <strong>release branch</strong> is created off of <strong>develop</strong>:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="reference/gitflow/GitFlowReleaseBranch.png" alt="GitFlow release branch" />
                </p>
                <p>
                    The code in the <strong>release branch</strong> is deployed onto a suitable test environment, tested, and any problems are fixed directly in the release branch. This <strong>deploy -&gt; test -&gt; fix -&gt; redeploy -&gt; retest</strong> cycle continues until you’re happy that the release is good enough to release to customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the release is finished, the <strong>release branch</strong> is merged into <strong>master</strong> <strong>and</strong> into <strong>develop</strong> too, to make sure that any changes made in the <strong>release branch</strong> aren’t accidentally lost by new development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="reference/gitflow/GitFlowMasterBranch.png" alt="GitFlow master branch" />
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <strong>master branch</strong> tracks released code only. The only commits to <strong>master</strong> are merges from <strong>release branches</strong> and <strong>hotfix branches</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Hotfix branches</strong> are used to create emergency fixes:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img src="reference/gitflow/GitFlowHotfixBranch.png" alt="GitFlow hotfix branch" />
                </p>
                <p>
                    They are branched directly from a tagged release in the <strong>master branch</strong>, and when finished are merged back into both <strong>master</strong> and <strong>develop</strong> to make sure that the hotfix isn’t accidentally lost when the next regular release occurs.
