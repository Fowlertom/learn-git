        <h2>DETAILS</h2>

        <div class="sectionbody">
            <p>Performing a 'push' is the process of updating a &#39;remote branch&#39; with anything missing from a &#39;local branch&#39;.</p>
            
            <div class="dlist">
                <dl>
                    <!-- COMMAND --><dt class="hdlist1"><em>git push -u origin &lt;feature_branch&gt; </em></dt>
                    <!-- EXPLANATION -->
                    <dd>
                        <p>Updates <i>&lt;origin/feature_branch&gt;</i> with any the missing commits from <i>&lt;feature_branch&gt;</i>. If <i>&lt;origin/feature_branch&gt;</i> does not exist, it is created.</p>
                        <p>'-u' adds upstream tracking reference - in case 'git pull' without arguments is used.</p>
                    </dd>
                </dl>
            </div>

            <div class="dlist">
                <dl>
                    <!-- COMMAND --><dt class="hdlist1"><em>git push -f origin &lt;feature_branch&gt; </em></dt>
                    <!-- EXPLANATION -->
                    <dd>
                        <p>Same as above. However, the '-f' forces the update to <i>&lt;origin/feature_branch&gt;</i> even though it is not an ancestor of <i>&lt;feature_branch&gt;</i>. This can effectively re-write history of <i>&lt;origin/feature_branch&gt;</i>. Use with caution (and the --dry-run option).</p>
                    </dd>
                </dl>
            </div>

        <h2>NOTE ABOUT FAST-FORWARDS</h2>
        <div class="sectionbody">
            <p>When an update changes a branch (or more in general, a ref) that used to point at commit A to point at another commit B, it is called a fast-forward update if and only if B is a descendant of A.</p>
            <p>In a fast-forward update from A to B, the set of commits that the original commit A built on top of is a subset of the commits the new commit B builds on top of. Hence, it does not lose any history.</p>
            <p>In contrast, a non-fast-forward update will lose history. For example, suppose you and somebody else started at the same commit X, and you built a history leading to commit B while the other person built a history leading to commit A. The history looks like this:</p>
            <div class="listingblock">
                <div class="content">
                    <pre>
      B
     /
 ---X---A
</pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Further suppose that the other person already pushed changes leading to A back to the original repository from which you two obtained the original commit X.</p>
            <p>The push done by the other person updated the branch that used to point at commit X to point at commit A. It is a fast-forward.</p>
            <p>But if you try to push, you will attempt to update the branch (that now points at A) with commit B. This does not fast-forward. If you did so, the changes introduced by commit A will be lost, because everybody will now start building on top of B.</p>
            <p>The command by default does not allow an update that is not a fast-forward to prevent such loss of history.</p>
            <p>If you do not want to lose your work (history from X to B) or the work by the other person (history from X to A), you would need to first fetch the history from the repository, create a history that contains changes done by both parties, and push the result back.</p>
            <p>You can perform "git pull", resolve potential conflicts, and "git push" the result. A "git pull" will create a merge commit C between commits A and B.</p>
            <div class="literalblock">
                <div class="content">
                    <pre>
      B---C
     /   /
 ---X---A
</pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Updating A with the resulting merge commit will fast-forward and your push will be accepted.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, you can rebase your change between X and B on top of A, with "git pull --rebase", and push the result back. The rebase will create a new commit D that builds the change between X and B on top of A.</p>
            <div class="literalblock">
                <div class="content">
                    <pre>
      B   D
     /   /
 ---X---A
</pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Again, updating A with this commit will fast-forward and your push will be accepted.</p>
            <p>There is another common situation where you may encounter non-fast-forward rejection when you try to push, and it is possible even when you are pushing into a repository nobody else pushes into. After you push commit A yourself (in the first picture in this section), replace it with "git commit --amend" to produce commit B, and you try to push it out, because forgot that you have pushed A out already. In such a case, and only if you are certain that nobody in the meantime fetched your earlier commit A (and started building on top of it), you can run "git push --force" to overwrite it. In other words, "git push --force" is a method reserved for a case where you do mean to lose history.</p>
